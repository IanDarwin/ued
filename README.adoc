= Ued: Outline of a Unix password file editor

This is a demo program that I mainly wrote for the May, 1999 _Linux Journal_
article on Java GUI Development. It can read a standard password file and
display it, but doesn't let you make changes yet.

Well, in fact, it only reads a file named "passwd.txt", but that file is
in the test tree, so you probably want to do:

	mvn package
	ln -s src/test/resources/passwd.txt .
	java -jar target/ued-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

== TODO items

If you extend it to have an Open function, and/or to save the file, or any
of the TODO items in the code, please send a pull request - thank you!

Have an interface do deal with the various shadow file formats on Linux,
BSD, etc.. Maybe generalize even more to include the macOS mechanism.
