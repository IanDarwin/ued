= Ued: Outline of a Unix password file editor

This is a demo program that I mainly wrote for the May, 1999 _Linux Journal_
article on Java GUI Development. It can read a standard password file and
display it, but doesn't let you make changes yet.
It was never intended to grow into a full-blown user editor,
but of course it might.

At present, it only reads a file named "passwd.txt", which is
in the _src/test_ tree and symlinked into "." so you can just do:

	mvn package
	java -jar target/ued-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

== TODO items

If you extend it to have an Open dialog, and/or to save the file, or any
of the TODO items in the code, please send a pull request - thank you!

* Open dialog
* Save function
* Groups support
* Have an interface do deal with the various shadow file formats on Linux,
BSD, etc.. 
* Maybe generalize even more to include the macOS mechanism.
